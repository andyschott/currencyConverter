# currencyConverter

This is a simple webpage that converts various currencies to dollars. It also includes the fee my credit card charges.

It uses [Open Exchange Rates](http://openexchangerates.org) to do the actual conversion. You will need to create an account and a new app in order to use this.

Once you have an AppID, you will need to create a global JavaScript variable called `open_exchange_rates_app_id` and set its value to your AppID.
